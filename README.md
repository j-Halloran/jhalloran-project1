# Jake Halloran CS 1520 Project 1
3 Pages, About Me, a google docs hosted resume, and a basic contact form
The Contact form relies on ajax and php therefore it was tested using XAMPP for windows
and chrome 51 for which it works.

Notes:
  Index page content was done last and therefore is very sparse comparatively
  Additionally, index page is not at all responsive. Viewing the form and my resume may
  work in non full screen 1080p browsers, but the index most certainly does not. It does
  look fine in Chrome and Edge at 1080p full screen but I would not be surprised if it broke
  under that width wise.
